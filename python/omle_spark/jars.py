"""Locate the JARs bundled with this package.

``pip install omle-spark`` ships everything the JVM side needs: the Scala
transformer, cross-built for both Scala versions PySpark uses, and the
omle-runtime JAR, which carries the native ``libomleruntime`` for every
supported platform at JNA's own resource paths. Nothing has to be built with
``sbt``, and no ``-Djna.library.path`` is needed on driver or executors —
``spark.jars`` ships the JARs to the executors and JNA extracts the right
native library from the classpath on each one.

JARs cannot be added to a JVM that is already running, so they have to be named
when the session is built:

    import omle_spark
    spark = (SparkSession.builder
             .config("spark.jars", omle_spark.jars_classpath())
             .getOrCreate())

Calling this after ``getOrCreate()`` has no effect; the transform would then
fail with ``'JavaPackage' object is not callable``, which is what PySpark
reports for any missing class and says nothing about the cause.
